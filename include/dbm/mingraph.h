 * Support for minimum graph representation.
 *
 * The minimal graph is represented internally by the cheapest format
 * possible, and in some cases it may even not be reduced. In addition
 * to this, the size of the minimal graph depends on the actual input
 * DBM, which makes the size of the allocated memory unpredictable
 * from the caller point of view.
 *
 *
 *
 * @section allocation How allocation works
 *
 * The idea is to have generic implementation that can be used with
 * standard allocation schemes (malloc, new) and with custom
 * allocators. This interface is in C to make it easy to wrap to other
 * languages so we use a generic function to allocate memory.  The
 * type of this function is
 * \code
 * int32_t* function(uint32_t size, void *data)
 * \endcode
 * where:
 * - \a size is the size in \c int to allocate, and it returns a
 *   pointer to a \c int32_t[size]
 * - \a data is other custom data.
 *
 * Possible wrappers are:
 * - for a custom allocator Alloc:
 *   \code
 *   int32_t *alloc(uint32_t size, void *data) {
 *     return ((Alloc*)data)->alloc(size);
 *   }
 *   \endcode
 *   defined as base_allocate in base/DataAllocator.h
 * - for malloc:
 *   \code
 *   int32_t *alloc(uint32_t size, void *) {
 *     return (int32_t*) malloc(size*sizeof(int32_t));
 *   }
 *   \endcode
 *   defined as base_malloc in base/c_allocator.h
 * - for new:
 *   \code
 *   int32_t *alloc(uint32_t size, void *) {
 *     return new int32_t[size];
 *   }
 *   \endcode
 *   defined as base_new in base/DataAllocator.h
 *
 * The allocator function and the custom data are packed
 * together inside the allocator_t type.
 *
 * @see base/c_allocator.h
 * @see dbm_writeToMinDBMWithOffset()

/** Save a DBM in minimal representation.
 *
 * The API supports allocation of larger data structures than needed
 * for the actual zone representation. When the \a offset argument is
 * bigger than zero, \a offset extra integers are allocated and the
 * zone is written with the given offset. Thus when \c
 * int32_t[data_size] is needed to represent the reduced zone, an \c
 * int32_t array of size \c offset+data_size\c is allocated. The
 * first \a offset elements can be used by the caller. It is important
 * to notice that the other functions typically expect a pointer to
 * the actual zone data and not to the beginning of the allocated
 * block. Thus in the following piece of code, most functions expect
 * \c mg and not \c memory:
 *
 * \code
 * int32_t *memory = dbm_writeToMinDBMWithOffset(...);
 * mingraph_t mg = &memory[offset];
 * \endcode
 *
 * \b NOTES:
 * - if \a offset is 0 and \a dim is 1, NULL may be returned.
 *   NULL is valid as an input to the other functions.
 * - it could be possible to send as argument the maximal
 *   value of the constraints that can be deduced from
 *   the maximal constants but this would tie the algorithm
 *   to the extrapolation.
