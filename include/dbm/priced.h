 *
 * Functions for handling priced DBMs.
 *
 * A priced DBM is a data structure representing a zone with an affine
 * hyperplane over the zone assigning a cost to each point in the
 * zone.
 *
 * A few facts about priced DBMs:
 *
 * - Priced DBMs have a positive dimension.
 *
 * - Priced DBMs are stored continously in memory.
 *
 * - The clock with index zero is the reference clock.
 *
 * - The affine hyperplane is given by the cost in the offset point
 *   and the coefficients of the hyperplane.
 *
 * - A closed DBM is never empty.
 *
 * Allocation can be handled by the library by using \c
 * pdbm_allocate() and \c pdbm_deallocate(). This can optionally be
 * combined with reference counting using \c pdbm_incRef() and \c
 * pdbm_decRef(), in which case \c pdbm_deallocate() is called
 * automatically as soon as the reference count reaches zero.
 * Reference counting is used to implement copy on write
 * semantics. Thus whenever you modify a priced DBM with a reference
 * count larger than 1, then that DBM is automatically copied. For
 * this reason, all functions modifying priced DBMs take a reference
 * parameter to the priced DBM to modify.
 *
 * A NULL pointer is equivalent to an empty DBM with a reference count
 * of 1. Functions that can cause the priced DBM to become empty can
 * choose to deallocate the DBM rather than to copy it. All functions
 * that do not require the input DBM to be closed will allocate a new
 * DBM when given a NULL pointer as input.
 *
 * Alternatively, memory can be allocated outside the library. In that
 * case \c pdbm_size() bytes need to be allocated and preinitialized
 * for the use by the library by calling \c pdbm_reserve(). Priced
 * DBMs allocated in this manner must not be reference counted.
