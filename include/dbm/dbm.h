 * @mainpage
 *
 * A dbm is defined as a squared matrix of raw_t. raw_t
 * is the encoded clock constraint @see constraints.h.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: in the system, you will typically have clocks
 * x1,x2...,xn. The dbm will have x0 as the reference clock, hence
 * dimension = n + 1 => ASSUME dimension > 0
 *
 * Format of a dbm of dimension dim:
 * dbm[i,j] = dbm[i*dim+j]
 * where dbm[i,j] = constraint xi-xj < or <= c_ij
 * The constraint encoding is described in constraints.h
 *
 * The API does not support indirection table for clocks.
 * Dynamic mappings must be resolved before calling these
 * functions. Be careful when dealing with operation that
 * involve arrays of constraints (e.g. kExtrapolate).
 * As a common assumption for all operations on DBM:
 * dim > 0, which means at least the reference clock is
 * in the DBM.
 * DBM non empty means the represented zone is non empty,
 * which is, for a closed dbm the diagonal elements are =0.
 *
 * Common pre-condition: DBMs are always of dimension >= 1.
